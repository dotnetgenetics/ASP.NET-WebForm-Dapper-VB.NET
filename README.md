# ASP.NET-WebForm-Dapper-VB.NET
ASP.NET WebForm Application using Dapper ORM that will Create, Update, and Delete data from the database using Repository Pattern. 
Before running the program, download the create table script (CreateTableScript.txt) from the ASP.NET-WebForm-Dapper repository and execute  using SQL Server Query Window. Make sure to 
change the target database in the script. This project does not include client or server validation, so it's up to you to update the project by implementing user input validations.
